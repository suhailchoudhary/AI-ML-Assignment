# Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom Industry

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction helps telecom companies retain customers by identifying at-risk individuals and taking proactive measures.

## Data
### **Data Sources**
- **Customer Interaction Data**: Call logs, customer service interactions, and complaint records.
- **Billing Data**: Payment history, unpaid bills, and frequency of payments.
- **Network Usage Data**: Internet data usage, call duration, and dropped calls.
- **Demographic Data**: Customer age, location, income, and profession.
- **Feedback Data**: Customer satisfaction surveys and Net Promoter Score (NPS).

### **Data Issues**
- **Missing Data**: Some customer details may be incomplete.
- **Imbalanced Data**: Fewer churn cases compared to non-churn cases.
- **Outliers**: Extreme billing or usage values.
- **Data Duplication**: Multiple records for the same customer.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR.

### **Types of Data**
- **Structured Data**: Numerical values such as call duration and billing amounts.
- **Unstructured Data**: Customer feedback, complaints, and reviews.
- **Categorical Data**: Subscription plans, region, and customer type (prepaid/postpaid).
- **Time-Series Data**: Monthly billing and service usage trends.

## Problem Statement
### **Objective**
Predict whether a telecom customer will churn (stop using the service) within a given timeframe using their historical data.

### **Business Impact**
- Helps reduce revenue loss by identifying customers at risk of churning.
- Enables telecom companies to offer personalized retention strategies.
- Improves decision-making by understanding churn behavior and factors.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
- **Data Storage**: CSV, SQL Databases
